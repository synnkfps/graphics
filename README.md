# graphics
generate "graphics" in multiple programming languages


the code may not be similar because in certain programming languages there is stuff that does not exist, and some programming languages do not have the same functionality as others, like, on Python, you can decrease the value of something that you are iterating on (with For loops), while on C you can't.

or even iterating between two different types of variables at the same time, in this case i have iterated between a list and a string at the same time:
```py
for i,j in zip(window_up, border_title):
  counter += 1
  window_up[counter] = j
  continue
```
